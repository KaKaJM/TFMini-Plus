# TFMini-Plus
Arduino Library for the Benewake TFMini-Plus Lidar sensor

The Benewake TFMini-Plus is a unique product and not merely an enhanced version of the TFMini. It has its own command and data structure. Therefore, various Arduino TFMini libraries are not compatible with the TFMini Plus.

At the moment, this library only includes two commands:
1) Read all data: distance to target, luminous intensity and device temperature; and
2) Get the device firmware version.
More to follow.

An example Arduino scetch is included here as "TFMP_example.ino".
