# TFMini-Plus
Arduino Library for the Benewake TFMini Plus Lidar sensor

The TFMini Plus is not a superior version of the Benewake TFMini. It is a unique product with its own command and data structure. The various Arduino TFMini libraries are not compatible with the TFMini Plus.

At the moment, this library only includes a command to read all device data: distance, intensity and temperature; and a command to get the device firmware version. More to follow.

An example Arduino scetch is included here as "TFMP_example.ino".
